# Pygame
## Maze Game in Python

This code is a maze game where the player controls a character, represented by a cat, navigating through a grid. The grid is defined by a list of lists, where each character represents a different type of cell: ‘X’ for walls, ‘_’ for open spaces, ‘F’ for food, ‘M’ for monsters, and ‘E’ for the exit. The player moves the cat using the ‘w’, ‘a’, ‘s’, and ‘d’ keys for up, left, down, and right respectively. The game ends when the player reaches the exit, touches a monster, or quits the game by pressing ‘q’.

The game also incorporates a scoring system, where the player earns points by collecting food. The game’s runtime and the points scored are recorded and saved to an Excel file. Additionally, the game generates and displays several plots showing the distribution of game completion times, a scatterplot of game completion times versus points scored, and a trend line of game scores over time. This provides an analytical perspective on the player’s performance over time. The game also uses a random seed to generate random positions for the food and monsters, adding an element of unpredictability to each game session.
